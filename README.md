# Learning Rust ðŸ¦€

## Overview

This repository documents my progress and notes while learning Rust, a systems programming language emphasizing safety and performance.

## Learning Resources

I am using two primary resources for learning Rust:

1. [**The Rust Programming Language**](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) - Completed. Notes on each chapter are included.
2. [**rustlings**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Currently in progress. This includes exercises for hands-on practice.

## Repository Structure

- `/the-rust-programming-language` - Contains notes for each chapter of the book.
- `/rustlings` - Includes solutions and notes for rustlings exercises.

## Usage

This repository serves as a personal log of my learning process in Rust. It can also be used by those seeking examples of Rust code or an understanding of the concepts covered in the learning materials mentioned.
